"""Relaunch the detached day jobs if a workspace restart killed them (happened 06:41 and ~13:45 UTC on 10/28).

Every job it starts skips finished outputs, so running this when the jobs are alive is a no-op and
running it after a restart resumes where the files left off. Run at the start of every round:
